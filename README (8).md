# poly mod 3

In this project, we are utilizing the Circom programming language to design and construct a circuit that embodies various logical gates. The aim is to create a functional and efficient circuit representation of these fundamental logic operations.


## Steps to run the command

Sure, here are the outlined steps to execute the program once the contract has been written using the Circom programming language:

**Step 1:** Run the following command to compile the Circom circuit:
```sh
npx hardhat circom
```

**Step 2:** Deploy the compiled contract using the following command, specifying the desired network (in this case, "mumbai"):
```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network mumbai
```

By following these steps, you will successfully deploy the contract and obtain the intended output from the program.
## Tech used

Certainly, here are the steps to run the program using Gitpod as the integrated development environment (IDE) for a Circom contract:

**Step 1:** Open Gitpod and navigate to your project directory.

**Step 2:** In the terminal, execute the following command to compile the Circom circuit:
```sh
npx hardhat circom
```

**Step 3:** Once the circuit is compiled, you can proceed to deploy the contract using the following command. Make sure to replace `mumbai` with the desired network if necessary:
```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network mumbai
```

By following these steps within the Gitpod IDE, you'll be able to compile the Circom contract and deploy it using the specified network.
